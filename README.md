# 8-bit_Priority-Encoder
Introduction
A priority encoder is a combinational logic circuit that takes multiple inputs and outputs the binary code of the input with the highest priority, usually the highest-numbered active input. This 8-bit priority encoder is designed in Verilog and is suitable for use in digital systems where the need for prioritizing signals is desired.

Features
Accepts 8 active-high input signals.
Outputs a 3-bit binary code corresponding to the highest-priority input.
It produces a valid signal to indicate whether any of the inputs are active.
Simple and modular Verilog design for easy integration.
Usage
Prerequisites
To use this project, you will need:
 
A Verilog simulator such as ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, or Synopsys VCS.
Some basic knowledge of digital logic and Verilog.
